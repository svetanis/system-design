# System Design Interview Prep 🏗️
Master the System Design Interview with a structured framework. 
This repository covers step-by-step solutions to popular design 
questions and explores the core components of distributed systems.

# 🎯 Project Goal
To provide a clear, repeatable roadmap for navigating 45-minute architectural 
interviews, from gathering requirements to identifying bottlenecks.

# 🚀 Core Principles
Understanding the trade-offs is the heart of system design.

**Scalability:** Handling increased load by adding resources

**Availability:** Ensuring the system remains operational

**Reliability:** The system performs its intended function under specific conditions

**Maintainability:** Ease of evolving and fixing the system over time

# 🛠️ System Components

**Load Balancing:** Distributing traffic across servers

**Caching:** Improving latency with high-speed data storage layer

**Databases:** Relational and Non-Relational storage

**Messaging:** Decoupling services with asynchronous communication 

# 📝 Interview Framework
When tackling a design problem, follow this structured approach:

**Understand the Problem:** Clarify goals and scale (DAU, QPS).

**High-Level Design:** Draw the primary components and end-to-end data flow

**Deep Dive:** Scaling specific components (e.g., Database sharding, Cache eviction).

**Bottlenecks:** Identifying and mitigating single points of failure.
